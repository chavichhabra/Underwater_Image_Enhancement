# Underwater_Image_Enhancement
Underwater Image Enhancement is a project aimed at improving the quality of underwater images by addressing challenges such as color distortion, low contrast, and hazy appearance caused by the water's absorption and scattering effects. This project uses advanced image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to restore and enhance underwater visuals, making them clearer and more vibrant.

Features
Color Correction: Automatically adjusts colors to restore natural tones.
Contrast Enhancement: Improves image clarity by enhancing contrast.
Dehazing: Reduces haze and improves visibility in turbid waters.
Deep Learning Integration: Leverages neural networks for superior enhancement quality.
Customizable Parameters: Fine-tune enhancement settings to suit specific needs.
Use Cases
Marine Biology Research
Underwater Photography
Surveillance and Exploration
ROV (Remotely Operated Vehicle) Operations
Coral Reef Documentation
Technologies Used
Python
OpenCV
TensorFlow / PyTorch (for deep learning models)
Matplotlib and NumPy (for visualization and computation)
